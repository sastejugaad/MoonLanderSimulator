# MoonLanderSimulator

This is an open-source project which aims to inspire young students in the field of space and technology by simulating a moon mission. This is a multi-disciplinary project we don't just rely on software to do all the work. We have a physical model of lander which has various sensors like gyro, accelerometer, camera, and wifi. Lander can transmit data and video feed
over wifi. On the other hand, we have our mission control center which is a program that receives the data sent from the lander just like a real moon mission.
The Control center filters this data and applies some maths to draw graphs and generate the rotation angles for the 3D model which represents the real state of the physical model.
This project was designed for beginners and is extremely user-friendly. The whole project is open source and only costs Rs.1200. More updates like object recognition and terrain mapping using the
the camera will be added soon.
